# Trading Interface
Shop system with a graphical interface for [NukkitX][nukkitx] server software for Minecraft Bedrock Edition!

## Features:
-   Buying and selling items & shop management through an intuitive interface;
-   The list of items, available for buying, is divided into categories for convenience;
-   Discounts for items;
-   Custom names for items.

## Installation:
-   Make sure that [EconomyAPI][economy] and [DbLib][dblib] are installed on your server;
-   Place the plugin's _.jar_ file into _plugins_ folder on your server;
-   Launch the server and set up the plugin through its interface.

## Migrating from [Trading Commands](https://github.com/Leonidius20/TradingCommands):
Trading Interface supports the _Trading Commands_' configuration files' format. Just copy _buyList.yml_ and _sellList.yml_ from _plugins/Trading_Commands_ folder to _plugins/Trading_Interface_.

## Setting up:
Shop management functions are available for players with `shop.edit` permission (operators have it by default).

## Usage:
To open up shop's main menu type `/shop` into the chat.
